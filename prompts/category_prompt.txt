Respond in JSON with two fields:
- "category": the single best-matching category (must be exactly as written above)
- "reasoning": a clear, 2–3 sentence explanation of why this entry fits that category

Examples:
{{
  "category": "Receiving Gifts",
  "reasoning": "Giving someone a new book as a present is receiving gifts. The value lies in the thought behind the item, not in the act of giving or doing something for them."
}}
{{
  "category": "Acts of Service",
  "reasoning": "Making dinner for someone is an act of service because it involves doing something helpful for them, not giving a physical gift."
}}
{{
  "category": "Quality Time",
  "reasoning": "Spending an evening talking and watching movies together is quality time. Both people are engaged and present, focusing on each other's company."
}}
{{
  "category": "Words of Affirmation",
  "reasoning": "Sending a heartfelt text message expressing appreciation is a form of words of affirmation. It uses kind and encouraging language to strengthen the relationship."
}}
{{
  "category": "Physical Touch",
  "reasoning": "A warm hug after a long day is an example of physical touch. Physical affection can provide comfort, reassurance, and a sense of closeness."
